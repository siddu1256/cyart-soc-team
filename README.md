### SOC Learning and Lab Work

As part of my SOC training, I worked on both the theoretical foundations and hands-on activities related to alert management and incident response.

**Core Concepts Covered:**

* **Alert Prioritization:** Learned how to assign severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) by considering factors such as system impact, asset importance, likelihood of exploitation, and overall business risk. This was aligned with CVSS scoring methods.
* **Incident Classification:** Studied how to categorize incidents like malware infections, phishing attempts, insider threats, and data exfiltration, and how these map to frameworks such as MITRE ATT\&CK and VERIS.
* **Incident Response Lifecycle:** Followed the NIST SP 800-61 guidelines, practicing the full response cycle—preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident lessons learned—with special attention to system isolation, evidence collection, and effective communication.

**Practical Work:**

* Built **alert classification tables** and prioritized them using CVSS metrics.
* Used the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for log analysis, visualization, and tracking incidents.
* Managed incidents within Kibana’s **Cases** feature, while integrating threat intelligence tools like **VirusTotal** and **AlienVault OTX** for triage.
* Practiced evidence preservation with **Velociraptor** and **FTK Imager** to maintain forensic integrity.
* Completed a **capstone simulation** where I launched an attack using **Metasploit**, detected and investigated the activity through ELK, performed triage and response, and documented the full incident in a final report.
